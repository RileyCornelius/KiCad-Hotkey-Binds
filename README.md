# KiCad-Hotkey-Binds

### Setup
1. Open up a KiCad schematic
2. Go to Preferences -> Preferences -> Hot Keys
3. Click "Open Preferences Directory" and back up the `user.hotkeys` file somewhere (rename to `user_backup.hotkeys`)
4. Click "Import Hotkeys..." and select `user_custom.hotkeys` from this repo. This will override `user.hotkeys` in the preference folder

### Cheat Sheet

There is a PNG cheat sheet as well as the SVG version that can be edited using [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
